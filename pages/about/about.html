    <p class="p_about">
        The Western Wall is a holy site for the Jewish people, a place for prayer and religious & national gatherings.
        The Western wall is one of four huge supporting walls built during the 1st century BCE, when Herod renovated the
        Second Temple.<br>
        Herod created a huge courtyard on the Temple Mount, with the temple at its center. The original height of the
        Wailing Wall is around 30 meters, and it is half- kilometer long. It was built on top of the original stones of
        Jerusalem.<br>
        Fillings and arches were built within the space between the walls and the mountain, and above them a paved 144
        thousand- square- meter courtyard the size of 12 modern soccer fields was constructed<br>
